Style Guide
===========

Organization
------------

Sub-sections should be organized as best as possible. If this isn’t possible,
default to using a second-level heading - organization can then be discussed
when near complete.

Grammar
-------

All bullet notes **must not** end in a period. Example:

>   - Key lime pie was delicious. Historians suggest Spanish sailors loved it
>   as people do today  
>   - Many kings had strong supporters in Europe

Vocabulary
----------

Ensuring consistency throughout all the major sections is essential, these terms
*must* use their alternative spelling **exactly as shown** rightwards to the
arrow. The following is the list of ambiguous terms listed by context.

-   The Americas

    -   Indians, natives → Native Americans
