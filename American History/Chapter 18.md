The Urbanization of America
---------------------------

### The Lure of the City

-   The urban American population skyrocketed after the Civil War; natural
    increase was only a small part of the growth. In fact, urban families
    experienced high infant mortality, lower fertility rates, and high death
    rates due to disease

-   Immigration also played a large role in urban growth as the opportunities
    for conveniences, entertainment, and cultural experiences attracted country
    families

-   Aside from giving women more social rights, giving homosexual men and women
    to build their cultures (though still hidden), cities gave people options
    for better paying jobs

-   New methods of transportation such as railroads and steam-powered ocean
    liners also attracted many people to the city

### Migrations

-   As a result of urbanization, the late 1800s became an age of unprecedented
    geographic mobility as many young Americans (mostly women desiring more
    opportunities) left the declining rural regions at a dramatic rate

-   Southern blacks also began to initiate migrations up north; however, job
    opportunities were strictly limited. Urban blacks often worked as cooks,
    janitors, domestic servants, and other low-paying occupations

-   The most important migrating source was the surplus number of immigrants
    arriving from a vast series of countries

-   However, most of them lacked the capital to buy farmland and lacked
    education; as a result, they mostly took unskilled work

### The Ethnic City

-   Equally striking was the vast diversity of immigrants in the Americas (New
    York was more Irish than Dublin and had more Germans than Hamburg; Chicago
    had more Poles than Warsaw)

-   In other countries, heavy immigration also occurred with immigrants coming
    from 1-2 sources: Argentina, for example, saw many Italian and Spanish
    people; America, in the 19th century, saw immigrants from Italy, Germany,
    Poland, Greece, Canada, Japan, China, the Netherlands, Mexico, and many
    others

-   Most immigrants came from rural backgrounds and adaptation to urban life was
    painful; in solution, they helped and gathered in many ethnic communities
    (often called “immigrant ghettos”) that tried to recreate the New World
    using Old World features

-   Even with the diverse population, ethnic communities offered newcomers some
    familiar cultures; things such as native language translated newspapers,
    native food stores, churches and synagogues, and cultural fraternal
    organizations

-   The cultural cohesiveness clearly eased the pain of separation from their
    native lands

-   From an economic perspective, it was clear some races had the upper hand in
    the hierarchy (Jews and Germans prospered more than the Irish, for example)

-   One explanation to this contrast was that by huddling communities together,
    some cultural aspects were considered valuable and thus prospered

### Assimilation

-   Despite cultural differences, all immigrants had some things in common: all
    suited together in cities, most were young, and all of their cultures were
    tied to compete against a powerful force -- the desire for assimilation

-   Many newcomers had romantic visions of their new lives; however, not only
    did they become disillusioned of America at first, they usually retained the
    dream of becoming ‘true Americans’

-   First and second generation immigrants did all they could to wipe themselves
    from their cultures in order to become ‘Americanized’ citizens

-   The urge to assimilate put a strain on men and women in immigrant
    communities; most came from countries where women were subordinated and had
    to handle pretty much everything

-   However, out of choice, women often left the house to form friendships,
    interests, and attachments; the result wasn’t just the collapse of
    family-centered cultures, but more was the adjustment of a more fluid life
    in the American city

-   Native-born Americans also contributed to assimilation both deliberately and
    inadvertently; public schools and employers expected English-speaking
    workers, merchants had to adapt to American products and diets despite some
    having their own cultural delights. Church leaders were often American or
    assimilated immigrants who encouraged parishioners to adopt American ways

-   Some even changed their theology and liturgy to make it compatible with the
    norms of the new country

### Exclusion

-   The mass amounts of immigrants provoked fear and resentment for Americans
    seeing their “foreigners” as the source of all disorder and corruption in
    the urban world

-   The rising nativism provoked many political responses

-   In 1887, Henry Bowers, a self-taught lawyer with a massive hate for
    Catholics and foreigners, founded the American Protective Association, a
    group committed to stopping immigration

-   In 1894, a more respectable organization, the Immigration Restriction
    League, founded in Boston by 5 Harvard alumni, was dedicated to the belief
    that immigrants should be screened and take literacy tests to separate the
    desirable from the undesirable

-   Even before these groups, politicians were struggling to find answers to
    “the immigrant question”

-   In 1882, Congress responded to strong anti-Asian issues in California by
    restricting Chinese immigration, despite only populating barely 1% of the
    West Coast

-   Also in 1882, Congress denied entry of “undesirables” and places a 50-cent
    tax on each person admitted; later legislation in the 1890s further expanded
    the list and increased the tax

-   However, these laws were minimally effective; they tried to pass a literacy
    requirement but President Grover Cleveland vetoed it

-   Also, most Americans who surpassed xenophobic ones often welcomed the
    immigrants and exerted strong political pressure against restrictionists

The Urban Landscape
-------------------

### The Creation of Public Space

-   By the 19th century, city structures were being reformed by planners,
    architects, and others to establish a more ordered vision of the city

-   One of the most important innovations were great urban parks; Frederick Law
    Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were the greatest promoters of this, responsible
    for forming Central Park and other parks in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia,
    Chicago, and Washington, D.C.

-   At the same time, great public buildings: libraries, art galleries, museums,
    theaters, concert halls, and opera houses were built, including New York’s
    Metropolitan Museum of Art

-   Wealthy residents served as patrons for these public spaces as material and
    social aspirations grew to match their expectations

-   These motives also produced valuable assets for the city too; inspired by
    massive European projects in Paris, London, Berlin, and others, American
    cities began to wipe out old neighborhoods and replace them with
    sophisticated buildings

-   In 1893, the Columbian Exposition in Chicago (to honor the 400th anniversary
    of Christopher Columbus’ voyage) was constructed using the popular
    “beaux-arts” style at the time, becoming the inspiration for what was known
    as the “city beautiful” movement -- led by architect of the “Great White
    City”, Daniel Burnham

-   Despite their aspirations to completely change American cities, they
    unfortunately achieved a small portion due to private landowners and
    complicated urban politics

-   In Boston in the late 1850s, a large marshy tidal area was gradually filled
    in with neighborhoods known as “Back Bay”: taking 40 years to form, making
    it one of the largest public works ever undertaken

-   Boston wasn’t the only one; Chicago, D.C., and New York also began to expand
    into new land and thus expand American boundaries

### Housing the Well-to-Do

-   One of the key problems in the growth was finding residential houses for the
    masses, including the fact that low wages and reduced building costs meant
    that people couldn’t afford moderate homes

-   Many rich residents lived in a lavish mansions and contributed to luxurious
    districts like Fifth Avenue in New York, Back Bay and Beacon Hill in Boston,
    Society Hill in Philadelphia, Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Nob Hill in San
    Francisco, and many others

-   The moderately “well-to-do” took advantage of cheaper lands near the edges
    of cities and settled in new suburbs near railroads and riverboats

-   Real estate developers promoted these suburban neighborhoods that’d appeal
    to the nostalgia of countrysides

### Housing Workers and the Poor

-   Most residents, however, couldn’t afford a house in neither the city or
    suburbs; instead, they stayed in city centers and rented, often having
    little bargaining power due to high demand and scarce space

-   Landlords were reluctant in investing in immigrant housing and tried to
    stuff in as many rent-paying residents as possible in small spaces -- such
    as Philadelphia and Baltimore’s narrow brick row houses and New York’s
    tenements

-   The first tenements were built in New York in 1850 and were designed as
    cheap lodgings and in 1870, had a law that required windows in bedrooms

-   Jacob Riis, a Danish immigrant, newspaper reporter, and photographer shocked
    the middle-class with his descriptions and pictures of his poor life in his
    book “How the Other Half Lives” (1890), describing the horrid life he
    experienced

### Urban Transportation

-   Urban growth also posed large transportation challenges as narrow roads led
    to heavy traffic (most roads weren’t paved and formed clouds of dust and
    large mud puddles)

-   Over the decades, more and more roads were paved; however, individual people
    needed more for day-to-day movement

-   Streetcars were introduced but after the Civil War, they weren’t considered
    fast enough

-   In 1870, New York opened the first elevated railway whose noisy steam
    engines meant fast commute times; Richmond, Virginia opened the first
    electric trolley line in 1888. In 1897, Boston opened the first subway line

-   One of the great marvels in the 1880s was the completion of the Brooklyn
    Bridge by John A. Roebling

### The Skyscraper

-   Not long after the Civil War, taller buildings that exceeded the 4-5 floor
    restriction began to appear

-   The Equitable Building in New York (1870) rose 7.5 floors; as years passed,
    even taller buildings reaching 10-12 floors appeared in growing cities and
    the term “skyscraper” became a popular description for them

Strains of Urban Life
---------------------

### Fire and Disease

-   One major problem for cities (often made of wood) were fires; “great fires”
    also occurred in Chicago and Boston in 1881

-   San Francisco had a catastrophic earthquake in 1906

-   Fortunately, these fires promoted innovative construction using fire-proof
    materials and the formation of local fire departments

### Environmental Degradation

-   Modern ideas of environmentalism were generally unknown to most people; but,
    the frequency of fires, disease, crowding, industrialization, and
    urbanization shared a disturbing reality for Americans

-   Improper disposal of human and industrial waste was common, which
    contributed to water pollution; domesticated animals and their waste
    contributed too; finally, air pollution was rampant as well, with frequent
    perpetual “fogs” (smog) occurring from industrial life

-   In the early 20th century, reformers strove to improve such conditions and
    by 1910, cities constructed municipal sewage disposal systems

-   Alice Hamilton, a physician who became an investigator for the United States
    Bureau of Labor, was a pioneer in identifying pollution in the workplace

-   Alice Hamilton documented the unbalanced and potentially dangerous
    substances such as lead, chemical waste, and ceramic dust creating
    widespread sickness; she published these findings to public attention

-   In 1912, the federal government created the Public Health Service, which
    focused on preventing such occupational diseases like tuberculosis, anemia,
    and carbon monoxide poisoning, as well as attempt to create common health
    standards for all factories

-   However, since the Public Health Service had few powers of enforcement, it
    had little impact

-   The Public Health Service did fortunately establish the protection of public
    health as a responsibility of the federal government and also helped bring
    public attention against the conditions

### Urban Poverty

-   Above all, the expansions created widespread and often desperate poverty;
    the sheer number of newcomers ensured many of them would be unable to earn
    enough for a decent life

-   Public agencies and private philanthropic organizations offered very little
    relief as most were dominated by the middle class who believed that too much
    help would create dependency and that their laziness and irresponsibility is
    a result of their poverty

-   Other societies like the Salvation Army (who operated in America in 1879, 1
    year after its founding in London) concentrated more on religious revivalism
    than homelessness and hunger itself

### Crime and Violence

-   Poverty and crowding eventually led to crime and violence; some minor crimes
    like pick-pocketing, con artist actions, swindling, and stealing were
    rampant

-   However, much more dangerous crimes such as homicide and lynching spiraled
    exponentially among all cities

-   Native-born Americans believed the crimes were a result of violent immigrant
    groups and cited the rise of gangs and criminal organizations in various
    ethnic communities, despite themselves being able to commit crimes just as
    easily

-   The rising crime rates prompted cities to develop stronger police forces
    compared to their original, private organizations; however, even law
    enforcement was susceptible to corruption and brutality

-   Middle-class members were fearful of urban insurrections and felt the need
    to protect themselves, and thus began the construction of armies

### The Machine and the Boss

-   New immigrants who couldn’t speak English needed help in adjusting to their
    new lives

-   Despite ethnic communities promoting self-help organizations, many residents
    turned to the political machine for assistance

-   The urban machine (deriving from the chaotic growth of cities) was the
    country’s most distinct political institutions

-   As a result, a new group of urban “bosses” emerged (many being Irish); the
    goal for a political boss was to simply win votes for their organization

-   This meant a boss had to provide voters with occasional relief to win
    loyalty of their constituents, even rewarding his followers with simple jobs

-   Machines were also an asset for money-making and engaged in forms of graft
    and corruption

-   Middle-class critics saw the machines as blights on the cities and obstacles
    to progress as well as being responsible for corruption, modernizing city
    infrastructure, expanding government roles, and creating stability in
    political and social climates

-   Several factors made boss rule possible: one was the sheer number of
    immigrant voters who weren’t concerned with middle-class ideas

-   Another was the link between political organizations and wealthy residents
    who served as patrons; another was the structural weaknesses of city
    governments

-   Fortunately, reformers posed public outrage against the urban machines such
    as Tammany; however, they lacked the permanence of the machines

The Rise of Mass Consumption
----------------------------

### Patterns of Income and Consumption

-   The growth of demand occurred in nearly all parts of society as a result of
    not just new techniques, but also rising incomes

-   Incomes were rising for everyone, though often unevenly, often resulting in
    the creation of vast new fortunes

-   Also important to the mass market were affordable products and new
    merchandising techniques such as ready-to-wear clothing

-   Partly as a result, much larger numbers of people became concerned with
    personal style, particularly women

-   Another example was prepared food ready to cook; canned food in particular
    and results of the techniques Gail Borden, an inventor and politician,
    condensed milk

### Chain Stores and Mail-Order Houses

-   Changes in marketing also changed the ways Americans purchased goods

-   Small stores faced competition from new “chain stores” like The Great
    Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company (A&P)

-   F.W. Woolworth opened his first “Five and Ten Cent Store” in Utica, New York
    in 1879 and went on to become a national chain of dry goods stores

-   Chain stores sold products at lower costs than local stores due to their
    mass production and efficiency

-   Despite opposition from traditional stores, most consumers couldn’t resist
    the greater variety and lower prices chain stores offered

-   Over time, more rural citizens gained access to the consumer world through
    great mail-order houses

-   In 1872, Montgomery Ward (Chicago-based traveling salesman) distributed a
    catalog of goods in association with the farmers’ organization: the Grange

-   By the 1880s, he was generally successful until he met competition with
    Sears Roebuck (first created by Richard Sears in Chicago in 1887)

-   Together, both men helped open thousands of rural people in the consumer
    world

### Department Stores

-   In cities, the emergence of department stores also helped shape buying
    habits

-   Marshall Field in Chicago, Macy’s in New York, Abraham and Stratus in
    Brooklyn, Jordan Marsh and Filere’s in Boston, and Wanamaker’s in
    Philadelphia are among the best known

-   One way department stores changed shopping habits was that they brought
    together an enormous array of products from previously separated shops

-   Secondly, they sought to create an atmosphere of wonder and excitement to
    make shopping more engaging
