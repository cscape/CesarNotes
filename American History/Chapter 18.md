The Urbanization of America
---------------------------

### The Lure of the City

-   The urban American population skyrocketed after the Civil War; natural
    increase was only a small part of the growth. In fact, urban families
    experienced high infant mortality, lower fertility rates, and high death
    rates due to disease

-   Immigration also played a large role in urban growth as the opportunities
    for conveniences, entertainment, and cultural experiences attracted country
    families

-   Aside from giving women more social rights, giving homosexual men and women
    to build their cultures (though still hidden), cities gave people options
    for better paying jobs

-   New methods of transportation such as railroads and steam-powered ocean
    liners also attracted many people to the city

### Migrations

-   As a result of urbanization, the late 1800s became an age of unprecedented
    geographic mobility as many young Americans (mostly women desiring more
    opportunities) left the declining rural regions at a dramatic rate

-   Southern blacks also began to initiate migrations up north; however, job
    opportunities were strictly limited. Urban blacks often worked as cooks,
    janitors, domestic servants, and other low-paying occupations

-   The most important migrating source was the surplus number of immigrants
    arriving from a vast series of countries

-   However, most of them lacked the capital to buy farmland and lacked
    education; as a result, they mostly took unskilled work

### The Ethnic City

-   Equally striking was the vast diversity of immigrants in the Americas (New
    York was more Irish than Dublin and had more Germans than Hamburg; Chicago
    had more Poles than Warsaw)

-   In other countries, heavy immigration also occurred with immigrants coming
    from 1-2 sources: Argentina, for example, saw many Italian and Spanish
    people; America, in the 19th century, saw immigrants from Italy, Germany,
    Poland, Greece, Canada, Japan, China, the Netherlands, Mexico, and many
    others

-   Most immigrants came from rural backgrounds and adaptation to urban life was
    painful; in solution, they helped and gathered in many ethnic communities
    (often called “immigrant ghettos”) that tried to recreate the New World
    using Old World features

-   Even with the diverse population, ethnic communities offered newcomers some
    familiar cultures; things such as native language translated newspapers,
    native food stores, churches and synagogues, and cultural fraternal
    organizations

-   The cultural cohesiveness clearly eased the pain of separation from their
    native lands

-   From an economic perspective, it was clear some races had the upper hand in
    the hierarchy (Jews and Germans prospered more than the Irish, for example)

-   One explanation to this contrast was that by huddling communities together,
    some cultural aspects were considered valuable and thus prospered

### Assimilation

-   Despite cultural differences, all immigrants had some things in common: all
    suited together in cities, most were young, and all of their cultures were
    tied to compete against a powerful force -- the desire for assimilation

-   Many newcomers had romantic visions of their new lives; however, not only
    did they become disillusioned of America at first, they usually retained the
    dream of becoming ‘true Americans’

-   First and second generation immigrants did all they could to wipe themselves
    from their cultures in order to become ‘Americanized’ citizens

-   The urge to assimilate put a strain on men and women in immigrant
    communities; most came from countries where women were subordinated and had
    to handle pretty much everything

-   However, out of choice, women often left the house to form friendships,
    interests, and attachments; the result wasn’t just the collapse of
    family-centered cultures, but more was the adjustment of a more fluid life
    in the American city

-   Native-born Americans also contributed to assimilation both deliberately and
    inadvertently; public schools and employers expected English-speaking
    workers, merchants had to adapt to American products and diets despite some
    having their own cultural delights. Church leaders were often American or
    assimilated immigrants who encouraged parishioners to adopt American ways

-   Some even changed their theology and liturgy to make it compatible with the
    norms of the new country

### Exclusion

-   The mass amounts of immigrants provoked fear and resentment for Americans
    seeing their “foreigners” as the source of all disorder and corruption in
    the urban world

-   The rising nativism provoked many political responses

-   In 1887, Henry Bowers, a self-taught lawyer with a massive hate for
    Catholics and foreigners, founded the American Protective Association, a
    group committed to stopping immigration

-   In 1894, a more respectable organization, the Immigration Restriction
    League, founded in Boston by 5 Harvard alumni, was dedicated to the belief
    that immigrants should be screened and take literacy tests to separate the
    desirable from the undesirable

-   Even before these groups, politicians were struggling to find answers to
    “the immigrant question”

-   In 1882, Congress responded to strong anti-Asian issues in California by
    restricting Chinese immigration, despite only populating barely 1% of the
    West Coast

-   Also in 1882, Congress denied entry of “undesirables” and places a 50-cent
    tax on each person admitted; later legislation in the 1890s further expanded
    the list and increased the tax

-   However, these laws were minimally effective; they tried to pass a literacy
    requirement but President Grover Cleveland vetoed it

-   Also, most Americans who surpassed xenophobic ones often welcomed the
    immigrants and exerted strong political pressure against restrictionists

The Urban Landscape
-------------------

### The Creation of Public Space

-   By the 19th century, city structures were being reformed by planners,
    architects, and others to establish a more ordered vision of the city

-   One of the most important innovations were great urban parks; Frederick Law
    Olmsted and Calvert Vaux were the greatest promoters of this, responsible
    for forming Central Park and other parks in Brooklyn, Boston, Philadelphia,
    Chicago, and Washington, D.C.

-   At the same time, great public buildings: libraries, art galleries, museums,
    theaters, concert halls, and opera houses were built, including New York’s
    Metropolitan Museum of Art

-   Wealthy residents served as patrons for these public spaces as material and
    social aspirations grew to match their expectations

-   These motives also produced valuable assets for the city too; inspired by
    massive European projects in Paris, London, Berlin, and others, American
    cities began to wipe out old neighborhoods and replace them with
    sophisticated buildings

-   In 1893, the Columbian Exposition in Chicago (to honor the 400th anniversary
    of Christopher Columbus’ voyage) was constructed using the popular
    “beaux-arts” style at the time, becoming the inspiration for what was known
    as the “city beautiful” movement -- led by architect of the “Great White
    City”, Daniel Burnham

-   Despite their aspirations to completely change American cities, they
    unfortunately achieved a small portion due to private landowners and
    complicated urban politics

-   In Boston in the late 1850s, a large marshy tidal area was gradually filled
    in with neighborhoods known as “Back Bay”: taking 40 years to form, making
    it one of the largest public works ever undertaken

-   Boston wasn’t the only one; Chicago, D.C., and New York also began to expand
    into new land and thus expand American boundaries

### Housing the Well-to-Do

-   One of the key problems in the growth was finding residential houses for the
    masses, including the fact that low wages and reduced building costs meant
    that people couldn’t afford moderate homes

-   Many rich residents lived in a lavish mansions and contributed to luxurious
    districts like Fifth Avenue in New York, Back Bay and Beacon Hill in Boston,
    Society Hill in Philadelphia, Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, Nob Hill in San
    Francisco, and many others

-   The moderately “well-to-do” took advantage
