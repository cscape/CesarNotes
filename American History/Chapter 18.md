The Urbanization of America
---------------------------

### The Lure of the City

-   The urban American population skyrocketed after the Civil War; natural
    increase was only a small part of the growth. In fact, urban families
    experienced high infant mortality, lower fertility rates, and high death
    rates due to disease

-   Immigration also played a large role in urban growth as the opportunities
    for conveniences, entertainment, and cultural experiences attracted country
    families

-   Aside from giving women more social rights, giving homosexual men and women
    to build their cultures (though still hidden), cities gave people options
    for better paying jobs

-   New methods of transportation such as railroads and steam-powered ocean
    liners also attracted many people to the city

### Migrations

-   As a result of urbanization, the late 1800s became an age of unprecedented
    geographic mobility as many young Americans (mostly women desiring more
    opportunities) left the declining rural regions at a dramatic rate

-   Southern blacks also began to initiate migrations up north; however, job
    opportunities were strictly limited. Urban blacks often worked as cooks,
    janitors, domestic servants, and other low-paying occupations

-   The most important migrating source was the surplus number of immigrants
    arriving from a vast series of countries

-   However, most of them lacked the capital to buy farmland and lacked
    education; as a result, they mostly took unskilled work

### The Ethnic City

-   Equally striking was the vast diversity of immigrants in the Americas (New
    York was more Irish than Dublin and had more Germans than Hamburg; Chicago
    had more Poles than Warsaw)

-   In other countries, heavy immigration also occurred with immigrants coming
    from 1-2 sources: Argentina, for example, saw many Italian and Spanish
    people; America, in the 19th century, saw immigrants from Italy, Germany,
    Poland, Greece, Canada, Japan, China, the Netherlands, Mexico, and many
    others

-   Most immigrants came from rural backgrounds and adaptation to urban life was
    painful; in solution, they helped and gathered in many ethnic communities
    (often called “immigrant ghettos”) that tried to recreate the New World
    using Old World features

-   Even with the diverse population, ethnic communities offered newcomers some
    familiar cultures; things such as native language translated newspapers,
    native food stores, churches and synagogues, and cultural fraternal
    organizations

-   The cultural cohesiveness clearly eased the pain of separation from their
    native lands

-   From an economic perspective, it was clear some races had the upper hand in
    the hierarchy (Jews and Germans prospered more than the Irish, for example)

-   One explanation to this contrast was that by huddling communities together,
    some cultural aspects were considered valuable and thus prospered

### Assimilation

-   Despite cultural differences, all immigrants had some things in common: all
    suited together in cities, most were young, and all of their cultures were
    tied to compete against a powerful force -- the desire for assimilation

-   Many newcomers had romantic visions of their new lives; however, not only
    did they become disillusioned of America at first, they usually retained the
    dream of becoming ‘true Americans’

-   First and second generation immigrants did all they could to wipe themselves
    from their cultures in order to become ‘Americanized’ citizens

-   The urge to assimilate put a strain on men and women in immigrant
    communities; most came from countries where women were subordinated and had
    to handle pretty much everything

-   However, out of choice, women often left the house to form friendships,
    interests, and attachments; the result wasn’t just the collapse of
    family-centered cultures, but more was the adjustment of a more fluid life
    in the American city

-   Native-born Americans also contributed to assimilation both deliberately and
    inadvertently; public schools and employers expected English-speaking
    workers, merchants had to adapt to American products and diets despite some
    having their own cultural delights. Church leaders were often American or
    assimilated immigrants who encouraged parishioners to adopt American ways

-   Some even changed their theology and liturgy to make it compatible with the
    norms of the new country

### Exclusion

-   The mass amounts of immigrants provoked fear and resentment for Americans
    seeing their “foreigners” as the source of all disorder and corruption in
    the urban world

-   The rising nativism provoked many political responses

-   In 1887, Henry Bowers, a self-taught lawyer with a massive hate for
    Catholics and foreigners, founded the American Protective Association, a
    group committed to stopping immigration

-   In 1894, a more respectable organization, the Immigration Restriction
    League, founded in Boston by 5 Harvard alumni, was dedicated to the belief
    that immigrants should be screened and take literacy tests to separate the
    desirable from the undesirable

-   Even before these groups, politicians were struggling to find answers to
    “the immigrant question”

-   In 1882, Congress responded to strong anti-Asian issues in California by
    restricting Chinese immigration, despite only populating barely 1% of the
    West Coast

-   Also in 1882, Congress denied entry of “undesirables” and places a 50-cent
    tax on each person admitted; later legislation in the 1890s further expanded
    the list and increased the tax
