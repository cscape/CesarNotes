Chapter 2
=========

Chesapeake
----------

-   Founded Jamestown (Virginia) in Spring 1607

-   The area was low and swampy, not ideal for survival; not to mention, a
    powerful nearby Native American tribe (Chief Powhatan)

-   Diseases such as Malaria, which English settlers weren't immune to,
    succumbed their numbers similar to the epidemic on Native Americans

-   No women at first were sent from the London Company as they did not believe
    in a “family” society

-   John Smith, a world-known sailor, came to the rescue and reorganized the
    system in Jamestown. Also organized raids on Native American tribes to steal
    food

-   During the winter of 1609–1610, it's known as “The Starving Time.” Native
    Americans killed their livestock, forcing settlers to eat what they could

-   Thomas West (3rd Baron De La Warr) created a harsh discipline on settlers,
    organizing them by usefulness. It did not last long

-   The income of tobacco (discovered by Cuban natives) was slow, but by 1818,
    it became profitable

-   The Headright System was made to give settlers land to work with, and then
    paying for it in shillings

-   Sir Thomas Dale, in efforts to contribute to Virginia’s expansion,
    suppressed the Powhatan natives and kidnapped the chief’s daughter,
    Pocahontas

-   Pocahontas was sent to marry John Rolfe to “civilize” the natives as a
    Christian convert; dying while abroad

-   The Virginia Company was on the verge of bankruptcy after spending all its
    money on a profitless Jamestown venture. King James I seized the charter and
    became the new head of the company

-   Farming then became a big deal in Jamestown when they learn techniques from
    Native Americans, corn being the star of the show

Maryland and the Calverts
-------------------------

-   Founded by charters of Lord Baltimore (George and Cecilius Calvert)

-   Cecilius (2nd Lord Baltimore) named his brother, Leonard, as governor

-   The Calverts sought settlers to grow, so they allowed Protestants (Calverts
    were Catholic), but soon realized they would become a minority

-   Tensions rose between the two, eventually forming a civil war in 1655 led by
    Protestants

-   Maryland became the source of tobacco cultivation

Turbulent Virginia
------------------

-   As Virginia expanded, so did border tensions with Native Americans

-   Sir William Berkeley became an autocratic governor, after many successions
    in fighting Native Americans and contributing to Virginia’s growth

-   In 1676, Nathaniel Bacon, a wealthy graduate from England, feeling grim for
    Berkeley’s refusal in his involvement in political government, created a
    large strike on Native American forces, after impatience to cover the
    governor’s careful approaches

-   Twice, Nathaniel Bacon liberated Virginia, resulting in Berkeley’s exile. He
    died from disease before he could govern Virginia

-   Sir William Berkeley, at the last second with British reinforcements, took
    down the remaining forces

-   Native Americans reluctantly signed a treaty, giving up their land for
    settlers

New England
-----------

-   Discontent with Catholicism, Puritans strived for a fresh start, beginning
    in Dutch territory

-   After a failed attempt to settle in the Netherlands, they receive funds from
    the king to use the Mayflower to settle in the colonies

-   Instead of landing in New York, they arrived in Cape Cod, which from the
    knowledge of John Smith, named Plymouth

-   The pilgrims endured harsh conditions until meeting the Native Americans.
    They interacted with the Native Americans fairly peacefully, learning
    survival tactics, and in October, celebrated the first Thanksgiving. It
    didn’t last long as remaining tribes perished from foreign diseases

-   William Bradford strived to be governor and agreed to a poor business
    decision that “guaranteed” the paid debt in use of the fur trade, while
    deliberately not providing the promised resources

-   The pilgrims were never wealthy, but dedicated themselves to Christianity to
    believe they were destined by God to arrive in the New World

The Puritan Experiment
----------------------

-   After King James I passed away, his successor King Charles favored
    Catholicism and thus fiercely targeted Puritan colonists

-   Unlike Plymouth settlers, Massachusetts Puritans were serious and
    materialistic in favor of God. It was a theocracy (a society in which the
    line between the church and the state were hard to see)

### The Massachusetts Bay Company

-   Puritan merchants created a new enterprise designed to take advantage of the
    resources in America, in where would now be Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
    They called it the Massachusetts Bay Company

-   The Massachusetts Bay company chose John Winthrop as governor, who isolated
    the company and established the single largest migration in the 1600s of
    over 1,000 people.

-   The port of Boston became the headquarters of the company but also spurred
    the growth of new towns including: Charlestown, Newtown (now Cambridge),
    Roxbury, Dorchester, Watertown, Ipswich, Concord, Subury, and others.

Expansion of New England
------------------------

-   The colony of Connecticut was founded after several disputes in the growing
    population of non-religious settlers in New England

-   After being exiled over extremist callings to disband the church and state
    of Massachusetts to prevent corruption, Roger Williams would be led by
    Native Americans to a land which would become Rhode Island

-   Followers of Roger Williams came shortly after and the government of Rhode
    Island allowed any religion, including Judaism, to worship without problems

-   Anne Hutchinson antagonized the leaders of Massachusetts about their members
    being non-religious currently running the colony and argued the treatment of
    women within the colony

-   Anne Hutchinson was trialed in 1636 for heresy, but prevailed strongly.
    Eventually she moved to Rhode Island and then New York in 1643, where she
    died during a Native American uprising

-   John Wheelwright, a disciple of Anne’s, led dissenters of the religion north
    to Exeter, New Hampshire, which separated into an independent colony in
    1679. Maine would remain part of Massachusetts until 1820

The Pequot War (King Philip’s War)
----------------------------------

-   In 1637, the Pequot Native American fought back against English settlers to
    expand into new land

-   Captain John Mason destroyed many villages by fire, almost completely wiping
    out the Pequot

-   In 1675, Wampanoags, angry over English treatment, rebelled with the help of
    white settlers and their leader King Philip resisted the English

-   The Pequot were easily taken down; most were executed or sold to slavery,
    despite help from a rival tribe (the Mohawks)

-   Within the war, a new rifle known as the Flintlock Musket was introduced,
    giving the Native Americans a substantial advantage over the older models,
    but were still overwhelmed in numbers against the English

The Restoration Colonies
------------------------

### The English Civil War

-   King James’ son, Charles I, established an absolute monarchy in England,
    bringing the British Parliament back, and alienating Puritan members

-   This caused a rising revolt in 1642 after Charles I was dismissed twice in
    two years

-   The Cavaliers (supporters of the king) and the Roundheads (Parliament
    forces, most being Puritans) fought. The latter ended victorious and
    beheaded the king

-   Oliver Cromwell, Roundhead leader who took the throne until his death in
    1658, where his son was unable to take the throne. In the end, Charles II,
    son of the beheaded king, claimed it

-   Charles II made the settlements in the New World permanent, in effort to
    receive large profits

### The Carolinas

-   Named after Charles’ name in Latin, these colonies were formed similarly
    like Maryland. It established an almost kingly state (like Lord Baltimore)
    and reserved large estates around the Florida peninsula, inviting any
    settlers of various religions

-   Promised political freedom but failed miserably, all seven but one remain

-   With help from John Locke, he drew the Fundamental Constitution for
    Carolina, which organized land and social positions within the colony

-   North and South Carolina behaved differently due to different economic
    foresees. North Carolina was mostly backwoods farmers while the South
    interacted with trading, especially with the overpopulated island of
    Barbados

-   After tensions between both regions, Charles II divided the regions as North
    Carolina and South Carolina, respectively

### New Netherlands, New York, and New Jersey

-   The English despised the Dutch due to exploitation in land and economy

-   In 1664, New Amsterdam was captured and the Dutch surrendered. In 1673, the
    Dutch reclaimed it but lost it for good the next year

-   James, the Duke of York, now clear from his title to New Netherlands,
    renamed and governed the colony of New York

-   After knowing of his father’s death (as the brother of Charles II) James did
    not establish a Parliamentary assembly

-   New York was prosperous and James achieved the throne as King James II

-   Shortly after receiving his charters, King James II gave that land to his
    political and former proprietors of the Carolina colonies, Sir John Berkeley
    and Sir George Carteret, with the latter naming the land New Jersey based on
    his birthplace

### Quaker Colonies

-   Named after “Society of Friends”, the Quakers were different from Puritans
    because they could assign a woman in the church and rejected the concept of
    predestination and original sin

-   The Quakers were largely unpopular in England for its practices as a
    democracy and lack of paid clergies

-   William Penn, son of an admiral from the Royal Navy, was attracted to the
    Quaker faith. He helped found Pennsylvania with assistance of his father’s
    will and other debts
